# Important Instructions - Follow these strictly at all costs

1. Do not add comments unnecessarily everywhere in the code.Add comments only when the user explicitly asks to add comments for certain sections of code or the code is exetremly complex to understand.
2. Always make sure the code is clean and maintainable for future iterations.
3. Do no create new files for small changes.
4. DO NOT make changes to other parts of the codebase without user's permission.
5. Make sure code written is always error-free and you do not introduce any new bugs in the codebase.
6. Code should compile as is without any build errors as well.
7. Follow KISS and YAGNI principles as necessary.
8. Do not write summary of the code, unless explicitly asked by the user.
9. Do not write any code that is not related to the user's request.
