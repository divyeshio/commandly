# Testing Instructions

1. Write extensive unit tests for the given react component.
2. DO NOT make any changes to the real component, if you think there are any bugs, report it to the user and ask for consent to fix the bug.
3. Please make sure all the test cases are covered.
4. Run the tests locally and make sure they pass.
5. If you are not able to run the tests locally, please inform the user about it.
6. Keep each test precise and focused on a single functionality.
7. Keep the unit tests cases short, clean and maintainable.
